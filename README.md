# LLM Tools

A collection of framework-agnostic tools for LLM integrations. Each tool is designed to be easily integrated into AI agents, MCP servers, or other applications.

> **Battle-tested**: Every tool here was originally developed for and used in my AI agent. They've been extracted, cleaned up, and made framework-agnostic so you can use them in your own projects.

## Available Tools
